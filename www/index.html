<p>The Funambol JSON Connector allows to access PIM data (contacts, calendar, tasks, notes) stored in Funambol server through a set of REST-like API. Instead of developing a native Funambol connector for the custom backend, with JSON Connector it is possible to shorten the development time and mobilize date faster.</p>

<p>The JSON connector is the link between the Funambol synchronization server, the JSON API and the custom back end. The datastore can be implemented using any technology, and must only implement properly the APIs defined by the JSON connector protocol. Testing tools are available to help the development and test of the custom backend.</p>

<p>Updated documentation is stored in <a href="/source/browse/json-connector/trunk/json/docs/">subversion repository</a>. Get started by reading the <a href="/source/browse/json-connector/trunk/json/docs/funambol-json-connector-design-document.odt">Funambol JSON API Specification for integrating with the Funambol JSON connector</a> and the <a href="/source/browse/json-connector/trunk/json/docs/funambol-json-connector-developers-guide.odt">Funambol JSON Connector Developer's Guide</a> (from svn).</p>
