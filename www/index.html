Instead of developing a native Java Funambol connector to mobilize PIM data for a custom backend (like a groupware server), JSON Connector allows to use any programming language. Its simple API also make development of custom sync feature much faster.</p>  <p>The JSON connector is the link between the Funambol synchronization server, the JSON API and the custom back end. The datastore can be implemented using any technology, and must only implement properly the APIs defined by the JSON connector protocol. Testing tools are available to help the development and test of the custom backend.</p>  <p>Updated documentation is stored in <a href="/source/browse/json-connector/trunk/json/docs/">subversion repository</a>.
